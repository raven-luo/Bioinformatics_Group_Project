We restricted the Database to Mouse.

We chose the first 2 transcripts.

blastn returns the most hits. megablast returns the second most hits. discontinuous megablast returns the fewest hits. We verified this using wc -l.

Some of the discontinuous megablast hits can be found in blastn hits, but blastn hits have more additional hits. There are no overlaps between megablast and discontinuous megablast, or between megablast and blastn. We confirmed this using for loops in Short_Answer_1.R
