We restricted the Database to Mouse.

We chose the first 2 transcripts.

blastn returns the most hits. megablast returns the second most hits. discontinuous megablast returns the fewest hits. We verified this using wc -l.

For the first transcript, some of the discontinuous megablast hits align with blastn hits, but blastn hits have more additional hits. There are no alignments between megablast and discontinuous megablast, or between megablast and blastn. There were no alignments in the second transcript. We confirmed this using for loops in Short_Answer_1.R
