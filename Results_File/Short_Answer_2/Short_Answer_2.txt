We chose gsta2 and Ptpn5, and built HMM protein models using primate sequences.

We searched the Obese 2 sequence.

The quality of hits was lower compared to when the HMM protein model was built using mice sequences.

We expected there to be much fewer hits, but the hit number turned out to be the same. 

We compared e-values in gsta2 and ptpn5_primates.txt.hmm.txt. e-values were higher when the gsta2 HMM protein model was built using primate sequences instead of mouse and rat sequences. It increased from e-131 to e-119. e-values were 0 for Ptpn5 regardless of the species from which the HMM protein model was built.
